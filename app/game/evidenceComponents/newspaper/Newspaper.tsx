      <h3>Vigil For Zach Cunningham to be Held Dec 20th</h3>

      <div>
        The KaiserU Department of Student affairs has announced a candlelight vigil will be held in
        the remembrance of Zach Cunningham on December 20th, in the east wing garden.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        Zach Cunningham took his own life on December 13. Cunningham was a senior majoring in
        biochemistry. His friends describe him as a &quot;bright person&quot; with a &quot;serious
        enthusiasm for science and the natural world&quot;.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        &quot;It was not uncommon for Zach to swing by my office with his latest theories,&quot;
        says Greg Clark, the head advisor of the BioChemistry department. &quot;His thirst for the
        pursuit of knowledge will be sorely missed&quot;.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>President Eric Lark released a statement following the passing of Cunningham: </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        &quot;I speak on behalf of all staff and faculty, we are deeply saddened by the news
        regarding the loss of one of our students. Our heartfelt condolences go out to the friends
        and family affected by this tragedy.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        The well-being of our students is always our top priority. We are committed to ensuring our
        mental health and counseling services are available for all.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        Out of respect for the family, we will not be releasing any further details. We ask that as
        a community we can approach this situation with compassion and integrity.&quot;
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        KaiserU Mental Health Facilities have extended their hours to accommodate students during
        this time.

      <h3>Mothers Against Occult Clubs Head Coordinator Speaks Out</h3>

      <div>
        Miranda Meadows, Head Coordinator of the non profit &quot;Mothers Against Occult
        Clubs&quot;, released a message to the Kaiser Country Community Board at yesterday&apos;s
        Sunday meeting.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        &quot;The rise of occult activity in public schools and universities is greatly
        underestimated,&quot; Meadows said in an impassioned speech. &quot;Parents should be
        concerned that their children may very well be experimenting with dark magic.&quot;
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        Yesterday marks the 3-year anniversary of the death of Scott Wagner, a high school senior
        who was killed in a deadly ritual conducted by an underground occult club at his high
        school.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        &quot;Kaiser Country is facing a crisis,&quot; Meadows continues. &quot;With unpoliced
        social media and internet access, it&apos;s now more than ever a breeding ground for bad
        influences to spread to young minds, and the occult epidemic is one of them.&quot;
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        Mothers Against Occult Clubs will be holding a community booth at KaiserU on Club Day to
        raise awareness of the dangers of occult clubs.

      <h3>Tea Club To Remain Closed Until Next Semester</h3>

      <div>
        Nearly two weeks ago, Kyle Singh, a second-year electrical engineering major, was admitted
        to the hospital after suffering a severe allergic reaction to one of the teas served at the
        KaiserU tea club. Since the incident, the club has remained closed and will not open again
        until next semester.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        The tea club was founded by club president Evelyn Samson, whose self-proclaimed mission is
        to &quot;show the world that tea is not just black and green&quot;.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        Unfortunately for Kyle, this recent incident only showed that drinking tea can be as deadly
        as drinking poison. Many students were shocked to hear that there was even such a thing as
        being allergic to tea. &quot;I thought you can, like, only be allergic to peanuts and
        gluten,&quot; said one student. “Now I might have to think twice about drinking tea.”
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        The KaiserU Department of Health advises all students to get their allergies tested to
        prevent future cases such as these.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        Evelyn Samson declined to comment on Kyle Singh&apos;s near-fatal allergic reaction.
        However, she did want to thank everyone who took the club&apos;s leftover tea after the club
        was forced to close, saying, &quot;I&apos;m glad at least the tea won&apos;t go to
        waste.&quot;

      <h3>Banned From Video Game Tournament. Justified?</h3>
      <div>
        {
          "Freshman Evan Worth was allegedly suspended from KaiserU's weekly Counter Attack 2 tournament for the rest of the semester. Worth claims it was because he was seen drinking energy drinks before a match."

      <div>
        {
          '"Is drinking Ace of Spades before a match considered cheating?" Said Worth in an interview. "What about a coffee? Can I not get a good 8 hours of sleep beforehand either?"'
        }
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        Tournament organizer faculty Daniel Katz claims the suspension has nothing to do with any
        pre-match behavior or rules.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        &quot;It was purely based on his conduct during the most recent match,&quot; says Katz.
        &quot;At Kaiser, we value integrity and sportsmanship above all else.&quot;
      </div>
      <br />

        The tournament is still looking for signups. If you&apos;re interested in the next Counter
        Attak 2 tournament, reach out to Daniel Katz for details.

      <h3>Duck Migration in Full Force Month</h3>
      <div>
        KaiserU&apos;s yearly duck migration is in full swing these past 2 weeks, with the American
        White-Breasted duck being the most common breed to be seen on campus. Although most students
        associate the returning of the ducks with the droppings that litter the sidewalk, others
        take this opportunity to hunt for something a little more auspicious: a feather with an
        intact quill.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        As any longstanding KaiserU student or faculty will tell you, finding a feather with an
        intact quill on campus might as well be a sign from the gods themselves. Find one and keep
        it in your room, and you&apos;re sure to ace your next test, have your crush text you back,
        or maybe even win the lottery.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        When asked if they needed any luck for this week, volleyball team captain Gina Moore replied
        &quot;Oh absolutely. We have an important match coming up. I take anything I can get.&quot;
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        Although it is unknown exactly when or how the superstition started, some professors claim
        it has been around as early as the 80&apos;s.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        Happy hunting, and if you do stumble upon some good fortune, don&apos;t forget brag about it
        on social media and tag #KaiserU on your posts.

      <h3>New Chemistry Lab Opens on 6th Floor</h3>
      <div>
        Professor Greg Clark announced the opening of a new chemistry lab on the 6th floor earlier
        today. The lab was bathed in controversy over budget concerns, as Clark advocated for
        expensive, high security storage units to be installed.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        &quot;There will be dangerous chemicals in there, some that could be fatal if
        ingested,&quot; said Clark in a statement. &quot;I need to ensure they are secured&quot;.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>Clark refused to elaborate what chemicals are kept in those storage units.</div>
      <br />
      <div>
        The statement quickly circulated among KaiserU social media, with the hashtag
        &quot;#whatsinthebox&quot; quickly gaining over a thousand uses among KaiserU-related posts.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        The lab is open to seniors in the BioChemistry department for limited use. According to one
        anonymous tip, the storage units still remained locked. So for now, the contents of these
        units remain a mystery.
